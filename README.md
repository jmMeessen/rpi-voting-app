Example Voting App (For Raspbery PI)
====================================

This is an example Docker app with multiple services, adapted for ARM processors using the Hypriot OS. It is run with Docker Compose and uses Docker Networking to connect containers together.

It is based on https://github.com/docker/example-voting-app

More info at https://blog.docker.com/2015/11/docker-toolbox-compose/

Architecture
-----

* A Python webapp which lets you vote between two options
* A Redis queue which collects new votes
* A Java worker which consumes votes and stores them inâ€¦
* A Postgres database backed by a Docker volume
* A Node.js webapp which shows the results of the voting in real time

Running
-------

As of docker-compose v1.6 `--x-networking` flag is no longer necessary:

    $ cd vote-apps/worker
    $ make build # Will pre-build the java application for the worker and copy it locally
    $ cd ..
    $ docker-compose up -d # Include --x-networking if using docker-compose version < 1.6

The app will be running on port 5000 on your Docker host, and the results will be on port 5001.

__NOTE:__ If running on a single RPi instead of a swarm you might encounter `ERROR: failed to parse pool request for address space "GlobalDefault" pool "" subpool "": cannot find address space GlobalDefault (most likely the backing datastore is not configured)`. This is because [you cannot create an overlay network on a single node](https://github.com/docker/docker/issues/19453). Comment out line 50 & 52 in `docker-compose.yml` that specify the network driver as overlay.
